Pomander
=======

A light-weight flexible deployment tool for deploying web applications. This project was inspired by [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) and [Vlad the Deployer](http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html), as well as being built on top of [Phake](https://github.com/jaz303/phake), a [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) clone.

This project came out of the need for a way to deploy Wordpress sites to multiple environments easily and without firing up FTP clients, etc. What started as a simple Rakefile, quickly grew into much more, and has been finally abstracted and ported to PHP to be able to fully integrate tasks with your application.

Getting Started
---------------

Make sure you have [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) installed:

```bash
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Installation
------------

I like to install Pomander globally so I can use it in any project.
Unfortunately, Composer does not have a way of doing this by default, 
so here is an easy way to allow global package installtion:

### Setting up Composer for global installation

```bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/gist/4242494/5d6344d2976e07d051ace18d41fa035113353e90/global_composer.sh | sh
```

### Installing Pomander

If you are using the global installation method from above, you can easily do:

```bash
$ cd ~/.composer && composer require pomander/pomander:dev-master
```

Otherwise, you need to add `pomander/pomander` to your project's composer.json:

```json
{
	"minimum-stability": "dev",
	"require": {
		"pomander/pomander": "dev-master"
	}	
}
```

You can also do this using Composer:

```bash
$ composer require pomander/pomander:dev-master
```

Test that Pomander is working with ```$ pom -T ```. If you get an error, make sure that the following is added to your path:

```bash
~/.composer/bin
```


Setting up a project
--------------------

### Step 1. Create a `deploy/development.php`

```bash
$ pom init
```

Once the file has been created, you will want to fill in the appropriate values.
You can also check out the [options reference](#options-reference) for help.

_Pomander also supports YAML deploy environments, but recommends using php scripts for extra customization._

### Step 2. Set up environment for deployment

```bash
$ pom staging deploy:setup  # staging is the environment name and uses deploy/staging.php
```

### Step 3. Deploy, and profit.

```bash
$ pom staging deploy
```

Use `pom -T` to see your available tasks.

Tasks
-----

```
deploy:setup      # Creates deploy_to folder, and checks out code.
deploy:cold       # Alias for deploy:setup
delpoy:update     # Updates code to current revision/branch.
config            # Attempts to create a default `development.yml` file.
```

### Custom Tasks

Feel free to modify these existing tasks, as well as create your own!

e.g.

```php
<?php

task('my custom task',function($app) {
  info("my task","Hello, World!");
});

after('deploy:update', function($app) {
  warn("pomander","You can use after() / before() to customize tasks");
});
```
